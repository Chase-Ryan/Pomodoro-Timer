# Pomodoro-Timer

<a href="https://project-pomodoro-timer-qualified-chase-ryan-solution.vercel.app/">Timer</a>




The Pomodoro technique is a time-management method that was developed in the late 1980s by Francesco Cirillo. 
It involves using a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
Each interval is known as a pomodoro, which is the Italian word for tomato. 
(Cirillo used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer when practicing this technique as a university student.)
